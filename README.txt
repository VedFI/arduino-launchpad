Arduino Launchpad v1.0 by VedFI

This is a school project.
Arduino sends clicked button information to GUI app through serial.(USB)
GUI app reads from serial and plays sound file related to button.
Launchpad GUI app uses Windows Media Player Library. App can play multiple sounds at the same time.

USAGE
- Flash source to your Arduino. (you can use autoplay_loop as main for testing)
- Run launchpad GUI app.
- Select sample music folder.
- Rock & roll.

Feel free to report the bugs if there.
